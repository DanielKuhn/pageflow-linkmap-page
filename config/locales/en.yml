          text: ! "# Hotspots\n\nLinks with configurable click areas.\n\nHotspots can play audio files, link to other pages in a Pageflow or to external websites. You can define as many hotspots as you want.\n\nDecide if you want to show a background image or a background video. (Keep in mind, that background videos will not be played on mobile devices, therefore use an additional fallback image for the mobile version)\n\nThe hotspot page type allows to use panoramic images that are wider and taller than the screen-size. It enables users to explore these images by horizontal or vertical scrolling.\n\nTo add a Hotspot just click on „Areas“ and choose between „Audio“, „Internal link“, or „External link“. \n\nThere are two ways to display hotspot areas:\n\n##  Hotspots as circles\n\nDisplay a white circle whose position and size can be defined by dragging. Click on the eye-symbol button of the corresponding hotspot and move this circle onto the desired position. If you use an audio file, a headphone-symbol will appear within the circle. The size of the symbol depends on the circle´s size. The circle becomes more visible when the cursor moves closer to it.\n\n## Individually designed hotspots\n\nAlternatively, an additional panorama image can be used to determine the look of hotspots when the cursor hovers above them. Two images have to be prepared:\n\n1. An image with all hotspots in an inactive state (e.g. a map with cities represented by black dots)\n2. An image with all hotspots in an active state (e.g. the same map with red dots representing cities)\n\nNow the rectangular hotspot areas are positioned to cover the graphic representations of the hotspots. When the cursor hovers above one of the hotspots, the corresponding part of the hover-image will be displayed inside the hotspot's area. That way the hotspot is displayed in its active state while all others remain inactive.\n\nIt is also possible to use videos instead of images. The following combinations are possible:\n\n1. Background image with hover image\n2. Background video with hover image\n3. Background image with hover video\n\nIf you wish to mark hotspots as \"already visited\" you can also upload a „Visited-Image“ which then shows a certain spot in a different color after visiting the linked page.\n\n## Text options\n\nBoth of these hotspot types can be entitled and have additional text/description.\nThe description editor contains basic formatting options like bold, italic & underline.\n\n## Atmo options\n\nEvery Hotspot page, can play an additional backround sound that can optionally stop or continue playing (at the same or a lower volume) while an audio-Hotspot is playing.\n\n## Further options\n\nRestrict scrolling to hotspot areas: Only scroll between hotspots.\n\nForce scrolling: Ensure there is a margin which ensures the panorama can be scrolled both vertically and horizontally.\n\nDeactivate scrolling at image border: Do not scroll in panorama view when user moves the cursor.\n\nExamples of application: Menu site, multiple choice, exploration tour"
